# Webpack - why another module bundler?
![what-is-webpack](img/what-is-webpack.png)

class: top
# Webpack - wat? (I)
* a *module bundler* - similar to browserify.
* takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
* features:
    *   **code spliting** & **chunks**
    *   **loaders**
    *   **plugins**
    *   **hmr** - inject updated modules into the active runtime
* installing
 ```bash
    $ npm i webpack -g
  ```
* running
```bash
   $ webpack
```
 ![webpack-cli-opts](./img/webpack-cli.png)

# Webpack - wat? (II)

* CLI options
```bash
   $ webpack --profile --progress --colors --display-error-details
```
![webpack-cli-opts](./img/webpack-cli-opts.png)
* running through npm
![webpack-npm](./img/webpack-npm.png)

# Webpack - wat? (III)
* can also be ranned using
    * *watch mode*
```bash
$ webpack -watch
```
    * *webpack-dev-server*
```bash
$ webpack --watch --profile --progress -colors --display-error-details
```
* as other workflow tools uses a specific configuration *webpack.config.js* is
considered as the default entry configuration
```javascript
    module.exports = {
        entry: {
            app: './app.entry.js',
        }
        output: {
            path: 'bundle',
            filename: "[name].js"
        }
    };
```

# Webpack - code spliting (I)

* 2 types of dependencies in the dependency tree: *sync* & *async.
    * async dependencies act as split points & form a new *chunk*

* **code spliting** = extracting common code into
    * a shared chunk
    * an on demand loaded chunk


* putting all code in a single file is not efficient for big web apps,
    so webpack splits your codebase into **chunks** which are loaded on demand.

* chunk content: all dependencies at a split point go into a new chunk & are loaded recursively

---

class: top
# Webpack - code spliting (II)


* chunk *optimization*:
    * If two chunks contain the same modules, they are merged into one.
    * If a module is available in all parents of a chunk, itâ€™s removed from that chunk.
    * If a chunk contains all modules of another chunk, this is stored. It fulfills multiple chunks.
* chunk *types*:
    * **entry** chunk = contains the runtime plus a bunch of modules
                  ->
    * **normal** chunk = contains no runtime but a bunch of modules
    * **initial** chunk (non-entry) = normal chunk + optimization treats it as more important as it
    counts toward the initial time ()

# Webpack Loaders
* are transformations that are applied on a resource file of your app.
* are functions (running in node.js) that take the source of a resource file as the parameter and return the new source.
* allow you to preprocess files as you **require()** or 'load' them.
* features:
    * chainable - are applied in a pipeline to the resource
    * sync OR async
    * accept query params
    * can be bound to extensions (RegExp in config)
    * can be called using short names ``babel-loader`` is equivalent to ``babel``
```javascript
    module.exports = {
        // ...
        module: {
            loaders: [
                {
                    test: /\.js/,
                    loader: 'babel'
                }
            ]
        },
        // ..
    };
```

# Webpack Loaders (II)
* can hook up loader config in webpack js
```javascript
    module.exports = {
        // ...
        module: {
            loaders: [
                {
                    test: /\.js/,
                    loader: 'babel!eslint'
                }
            ]
        },
        eslint: {
            configFile: '.eslintrc',
            failOnError: true
        }
        // ..
    };
```

# Webpack Loaders (III)
* When it comes to transforming css/less/bla style files
    * it's possible to embed stylesheets into a webpack javascript bundle (require them)
    * extract them using *extract-text-webpack-plugin*
```javascript
var ExtractTextPlugin = require("extract-text-webpack-plugin");
module.exports = {
    module: {
        loaders: [
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract("style-loader", "css-loader")
            },
            {
                test: /\.less$/,
                loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract("style", "css!less")
            },
            { test: /\.png$/, loader: "url-loader?mimetype=image/png" }
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        new ExtractTextPlugin('styles.css'),
        new ExtractTextPlugin('lessStyles.css')
    ]
};
```

# Webpack Plugins (I)
* case study
```javascript
module.exports = {
    // ..
    plugins: [
      new CopyPlugin([
        {
          from: './src/img',
          to: 'img'
        }
      ]),
      new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        title: '@play',
        template: './src/src-index.html',
        filename: 'index.html'
      }),
      new ExtractTextPlugin("css/app.css"),
      new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
          children: true,
          minChunks: Infinity
      }),
      new webpack.NoErrorsPlugin(),
      new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
    ]
    // ..
};
```

# Webpack Plugins (II)
* *essentially*, **each plugin call binds a callback to fire at specific steps
  throughout the build process**
* offer you a way to
    * hook up into the build process
    * optimize it (optimize in production mostly

* a *plugin* is installed once, calling its ``apply()``, as Webpack starts up
